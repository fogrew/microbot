Telegram bot for sending messages to git repositories as files.

**IN DEVELOPMENT NOW! Use at your own risk!**

## Getting started

### Telegram token

To use the [Telegram Bot API](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api), 
you first have to [get a bot account](https://core.telegram.org/bots) 
by [chatting with BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather).

BotFather will give you a *token*, something like `123456789:AbCdfGhIJKlmNoQQRsTUVwxyZ`.

### Setup microbot

After cloning this repo, create file `.env` based on `.env.example` file at root folder of this repo.

To use the token, add it to the `.env` file as `BOT_TOKEN` variable.

## Development

Run `npm start` to start local server with a telegram bot.

## Usage

Now this bot prepared only for local running. Project still in development.
